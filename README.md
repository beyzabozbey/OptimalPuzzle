# OptimalPuzzle

This project generates puzzles to find a good puzzle that is optimized to be challenging and entertaining by using simulated annealing. For the project description, please see the "Programming Part" of proj2-2.pdf.

## How to compile and run

In order to compile and run for the default puzzle size, use `make` command. It will generate `PuzzleGenerator` executable. You can run the program for other puzzle sizes by using `./PuzzleGenerator r c i j` for a puzzle of size \
_r x c_ where each cell contains an integer between _i_ and _j_ (inclusive).
